title: On Deep Learning Models Cheating!
---

Consider a deep learning convolutional model hat have been trained on ImageNet. Call this model "Cheater". Why cheater? Figure it yourself. Feed this model a picture of a cat that have been augmented with an elephant pattern. How will the model classify it. As an Elephant! Why this happen? Because the model was cheating while training and used learning shortcuts to optimize over training dataset. This article talks about Deep Learning Shortcut Learning, which seemingly looks like as if the model is "cheating" while trining.
